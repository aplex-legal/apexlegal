                <p class="article-author">By Soubam Nongpoknganba Meitei, Managing Partner, Apex Legal Solutions</p>
                
                <div class="article-content">
                    <blockquote>
                        "Sir Jhalajit …… said, "Touthok-khro ! ……. Sir Jhalajit replied that there would be no problem as the Chief Minister and DGP already have knowledge and consented to it…… I was alone and facing Sanjit, then, I removed my pistol from the holster and shot him about six times. He died at the spot……."
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>This confession and allegation by Head Constable Herojit before the media has shocked the conscience of all of us beyond limit. We have been hearing about police atrocities, their extremism and their manoeuvring of investigation since so long but such unmasking of the cruel truth and that too from the perpetrators themselves has been unparalleled. This Herojit episode has once again brought to the fore, the extreme necessity for policing the police of the state. Though there may be denial and counter denial against such confession and serious allegation against senior officers and political boss before the media, it will have far reaching impact on every front of the criminal justice dispensation system not only in the state but in the entire country too.</p>

                    <p>This event more than clearly indicates the mammoth flaw in the policing system and the related legal rules of the country. However this too cannot be denied that there is not a single system established by human beings which is cent percent full proof of flaw, nevertheless it should be accepted that the level of content of flaws can always be brought down to acceptable degree and needless to say, the flaws in the policing system in the state as on date as is brought forth by the Herojit episode is far from the acceptable level and hence the whole policing system should be revamped or perhaps remodeled.</p>

                    <p>Police is one of the most important agencies of the state without which criminal justice system will become naught and today's society will simply crumble down without a trace. Such is the importance of the police in the society but the police that we have with us today is simply a totally opposite force and to a lot of people, is villainous. Acknowledging the importance of police, the Justice Verma Committee on amendment to criminal law which was set up after the Nirbhaya Rape case, in its report submitted on 23rd January 2013 took the view that the majority of the fundamental rights set out in Part III of the Constitution require an efficient, sensitive and impartial police force for fulfilment in the way the drafters of the Constitution intended.</p>

                    <p>And needless to say, a politicized and criminalized police force will only be an agent of violations of the sacred fundamental rights of the people. In fact a Human Rights Watch and People's Watch Report in 2009 claimed that around 1.8 million people are being subjected to torture in police custody across the country. This eerie situation will further divide the people and the police, the latter becoming only a tool in the hands of the powerful to enslave the whole populace and ultimately eroding the whole social fabric. Today, therefore we need a people's police.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "Independent India must choose whether we will have a people's police or a ruler appointed police, or in other words whether the people should rule or whether the parties should rule. The Constitution has laid down that the people should rule, so the police must also be the people's police" - Khosla Commission, 1968
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>But it seems we are still not coming out of the British mould.</p>

                    <p>The revelations by Herojit uncover two basic flaws in the police system of the state namely the unholy politicization of the police bringing corruption into the system and further criminalizing the police system and secondly the unaccountability of the police force for their misdeeds reinforcing and further deepening the roots of corruption and criminalization into the system.</p>

                    <p>Politicization of the police in India has always been a major complaint and concern. Constant interference in day-to-day working of the department, frequent transfer of officials, and postings guided by political considerations and not by exigencies of service and situational requirement, have become the bane of India's police system. But studies have discovered that the fault does not always lie with the politicians alone and to a great extent, it seems most of the political interventions occur because the police themselves offer to be maneuvered and obviously for a price.</p>

                    <p>Whatever may be the cause and course of politicization, it ever injures the whole police system and hence needs to be done away. Further the second flaw has made people to ask, who will police the police. But in democracies the question of "who guards the guardians" has always been a tricky problem. It is not unnatural that police can be used to deny true justice and such instances are not lacking in the state and perhaps this is one of the most profound reason for people resorting to mob justice and therefore their act or omissions leading to such denial of justice to the public should be taken into consideration if a people's police is to be engineered.</p>

                    <h3>MANIPUR IS LEGALLY VIOLATED?</h3>

                    <p>A peep into the Manipur situation will make anyone but pant in distress as the situation here is worse. But even a streak of thought for bettering the police system have not perhaps crossed the minds of successive governments while even the neighbouring state of Mizoram has made an effort toward ameliorating the lots by enacting the Mizoram Police Manual though still far from lets say, satisfying and framing a new Act for itself but Manipur still continues to rely on the Assam Police Manual which was adopted in the state way back in the year 1974 and which has been frequently criticize as being colonial remains.</p>

                    <p><strong>This manual suffers from the following limitations among others:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Colonial Legacy:</strong> The manual prioritizes authority and control over community partnership, which is misaligned with democratic policing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Out-dated disciplinary procedures:</strong> Rule 66 gives the Governor sweeping revisional powers and denies a statutory right to defence assistance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Technology Gap:</strong> No provisions for cybercrime units, digital forensics, AI surveillance, or data-driven policing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Human Rights & Accountability:</strong> Limited emphasis on transparency, accountability, and citizen rights.</li>
                        <li><strong>Community Policing:</strong> Weak focus on participatory policing models, neighbourhood watch, or trust-building with citizens.</li>
                        <li><strong>Training & Professional Development:</strong> Out-dated training modules; insufficient focus on psychological counselling, gender sensitivity, and soft skills.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>THE NEED</h3>

                    <p>In an article entitled "The armed police in the British colonial tradition: The Indian perspective", the authors Dilip K Das and Arvind Verma has highlighted that out of the two police systems viz., Scotland yard and Irish Constabulary, the British implanted into India the Irish Constabulary (later Royal Irish Constabulary) as it was a semi-military, centrally controlled police force designed to protect British imperial interests, suppress dissent, and maintain law and order rather than serve citizens.</p>

                    <p><strong>Contrary to the Irish model, Scotland Yard emphasised on:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Crime Prevention over Suppression:</strong> Early constables were tasked primarily with preventing crime, patrolling neighbourhoods, and deterring offenses.</li>
                        <li><strong>Public Assistance:</strong> Officers were trained to respond to emergencies, reassure citizens, and provide help in critical situations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Professional Investigation:</strong> Scotland Yard became famous for its detective branch, focusing on evidence collection, forensic science, and solving complex crimes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Civilian Orientation:</strong> Unlike the Irish Constabulary or colonial Indian police, Scotland Yard was unarmed and operated as a civilian service accountable to local government.</li>
                        <li><strong>Innovation in Policing:</strong> Introduced modern techniques such as fingerprinting, criminal profiling, and systematic record-keeping during the Victorian era.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Supreme Court Directives in Prakash Singh Case</h3>

                    <p>It is in the face of such inaction on the part of the Government that the direction of the Honourable Supreme Court of India as given out in the case of Prakash Singh and others Vs Union of India decided on 22nd September 2006 has become all the more necessary for police reformation in the state. The Court issued seven key directives:</p>

                    <p>This compliance chart was prepared by CHRI on the basis of the affidavit submitted by the State Government to the Supreme Court. However quite unfortunately, we public can see nothing physical on the ground as to the constitution of the State Security Commission, Police Complaints Authorities and Police Establishment Board though the same has been done as per the said chart.</p>

                    <p>The separation of investigation and law and order maintenance is of vital importance in the state of Manipur as according to the authority themselves, there is a much higher degree of law and order problem in the state than other parts of the country. However for reasons not known to the public, the government has misinterpreted the directives of the Court and has evaded compliance of such monumental directive.</p>

                    <p>As for the other directives, the state government has already said, they have complied in the year 2006-2007 but after ten years from their stated compliance, we public are seeing nothing on the ground. The website of the Manipur Police also does not disclose anything about such compliance nor about the establishment of such Commission, etc. and the Manipur police remains where it was – a high handed regime protector with no accountability for their wrongs.</p>
